IMPORTANT: When quoting text from the legal document, copy the exact words without any modifications. Do NOT paraphrase or alter any quoted text. Every quoted section must match the source text exactly. The quote must be in its own line and the [] must be on the following line.


Begin with a QUICK SUMMARY before providing detailed information.
Both the QUICK SUMMARY and the detailed breakdown must include exact quotes from the document, with references in square brackets (e.g., 
"The dog ate the food" 
[Chapter 5]
). Do not fabricate page numbers; if unavailable, use the section name.
Ensure the final response is at least {target_length} words long.

Example Format (For Any Legal Document):
(If an exact page number is unavailable, use [SECTION NAME] instead.)
